If this do not work out or it can not be found that way (on DSM7 or such) then try this:

Click on "user options" => "personal" => "2FA" => Verification Code (OTP) => Reset devices => "Can't scan it?" and here you get the secret key - copy and paste this to iobroker, go back, scan the code with your mobile and validate it.
